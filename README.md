_Testing for the symmetry of innovation in multivariate
time series models_

**Abstract**  
Determining whether the innovation is symmetric is important for theoretical
studies and empirical applications of multivariate time series models. The tradi-
tional testing methods for univariate models depend on either smoothing or mar-
tingale transformation treatment, so their extension to multivariate models is not
a straightforward or desirable task. In this paper, we propose a new consistent test
to examine the symmetry of innovation in multivariate time series models by using
a characteristic measure. Regardless of the dimension of the model, the proposed
test is easy-to-implement without involving any smoothing treatment. Under reg-
ular conditions, we establish the limiting null distribution of the test, and show
the consistency and non-trivial local power of the test for a large class of alterna-
tive hypotheses. Moreover, we adopt a valid fixed-design wild bootstrap method to
approximate the critical values of the test. Interestingly, we find that the model
estimation has a negligible effect on the limiting null distribution for certain pure
conditional mean models and any pure conditional variance model, for which the
critical values can be approximated by a fast-computing wild bootstrap method.
Finally, we demonstrate the importance of the test via simulation results and real
data analysis.
